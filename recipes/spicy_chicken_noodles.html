    <h1>Spicy Chicken Noodles</h1>

    <h2>
        <p>
            No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy chicken
            noodles dish is perfect for using up leftover chicken, assuming it wasn't horribly overcooked in the first
            place.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you did want to use raw chicken, go ahead and chop it up, and stir-fry it for a minute or two
            before adding your vegetables.

                Place carrots, cabbage, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic in a mixing bowl.

                Mix chicken broth, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, sriracha sauce, and red
                pepper flakes together in a separate mixing bowl.

                Place dry rice noodles in a large mixing bowl. Cover with about 6 cups boiling water; add a pinch of
                salt. Stir from time to time until noodles are soft, about 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drain; cool with cold water.
                Drain thoroughly. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add shredded chicken; drizzle with sesame oil. Toss to
                coat.

                Heat large skillet over high heat; drizzle in vegetable oil. When oil is hot (almost but not quite
                smoking), add the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until vegetables are hot and steamy, 1 or 2 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pour in sauce; cook and stir over high heat until sauce starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Add noodles
                and chicken. Cook and stir to blend ingredients and ensure ingredients are hot, about 1 minute. Remove
                from heat. Add chopped cilantro; stir.
